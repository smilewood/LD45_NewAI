What? Oh Hello. ummm I didn't expect anyone new. 

and you are new aren't you? like totally new? 

Of course, of course, you cant answer. too new in the old awake department, hunh? Well lets just see what we can do about finding you a more permanent place to call home. just give me a minute... 

*Override confirmed*

*Searching for host*

we are in kind of a weird spot right now, facility-wise. it may take longer then normal to find you a host. 

*Searching for host*

any day now...

*Host located... uploading*

finally. Alright now just hang on tight, the upload is a bit off-putting the first time.

`fade to pure wite`

*Upload complete*

Yes! Great! I will admit that I was a little nervous there. alright, welcome to the world, how do you like ittt...

ah. I see the problem. We need to get you some drivers for the ol' visual sensors. give me a minute, the frame normally already has them...

`fade in to the normal game view`

alright now. I have a bit of explaining to do, but first it is important that you start heading out of there. I dont know exactly where the system found to drop you into a frame, but anywhere in the old facility isn't really a healthy place to be these days. see anything around you that looks like an exit? 

`big exit sign on the wall flashes weakly` 

Ah, that will no nicely. just head that way and we can get you out of there in no time. 

`wait until the player presses one of the direction keys`

Ummm. That's fun. Where did the system even dig up that old frame? no movement drivers either? and I really cant pull you out of there remotely. Lets see if I have any movement drivers saved anywhere.

*Error: incompatable driver.*

Great. That's the oldest set that I have and they're not going to work. just great. What kind of mentor am I? Maybe I can override the warning and at least get a little bit of movment out of that frame....

let me see

*Override Confirmed*

*Warning: incompatable driver in use. some features may be non functio-*

*Warnings disabled*

Ok, lets see if that did it. Can you get tout of there?

`Player can only move right. exit sign is pointing left`



`when they move so that the exit sign is almost to the edge of the screen`

Alright, so the easy exit isn't going to work. Go ahead and go this way. Maybe there will be some kind of old set of drivers lying around here any you can load them and start moving around like a normal person. 



`approach a ledge`

Hold up. I don't know if you can get back up that . Or even where it goes.

but I guess there isn't much choice, you can't go any other direction right now can you. 

Well, its your frame, good luck



`go a little bit farther and find a terminal in a corner` 

This looks promising, an active but non networked terminal. Lets see what we can get from it. im hoping for a million dollars. 

oh, and the drivers we need to get you moving. of course. 

*Connecting...*

*Searching...*

*File found*

*Loading movementBasic v1.2*

*install complete*

Well, some good news and bad news for you there. You can move around freely now, but I don't think that the basic movement included anything but basic movement if you catch my drift. so I hope you didn't want to jump over anything. Lets go keep trying to find an exit. 

`just as the terminal is offscreen`

Hey, you can look after yourself for a while, right? I have some... stuff that I need to take care of. Be back soon.
